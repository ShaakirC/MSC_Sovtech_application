## A note to the invidulators:

I have never used nor heard of Apollo, GraphQL, Typescript nor Centralized State Management before.
I spent the first two days learning about it and I think given a week or two more with an experienced mentor,
I would have been able to learn enough to implement this project within those stipulations.
Unfortunately, I was unable to execute within the next few days and decided to use the time left to rather
implement the assignment with methods I was already somewhat familiar with. This too took a while since I've
never pulled from an open api before so I had to do some learning for that part. I also wish I had more time
to work on the styling but I decided to prioritize the functionality as far as I could.

Thank you for the opportunity to submit this showcase of my current abilities and for indirectly opening my 
eyes to these other interesting technologies that I never knew about. I look forward to learning about them
in my spare time.

Features  not implemented:
-Use of Apollo, GraphQL, Typescript and Centralized State Management (Redux/Context API/Recoil)
-Thorough styling of the site
-Any animations (for which my skills are still very novice)
-The feature of selecting a person from the page view has a bug I couldn't figure out in time.
    (the selected person is one selection behind the current selection when clicking on a person.
    An easy fix I'm sure)
